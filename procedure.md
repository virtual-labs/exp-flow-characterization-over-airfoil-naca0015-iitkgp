# Procedure


1. Fix the airfoil in the wind tunnel with the leading edge facing the flow and ensure α = 0<sup>o</sup>.

2. Connect the reference port of the DSA3217 to the pressure port at the inlet of the test section.

3. Connect a port on DSA3217 with the airfoil pressure port using a pneumatic tube. The reading at the connected port is now  (P<sub>x</sub>- P<sub>∞</sub>).

4. Connect a port on DSA3217 with the pressure port at the settling chamber using a pneumatic tube. The reading at the connected port is now(P<sub>0</sub>- P<sub>∞</sub>).

5. Zero calibrate the transducer, i.e., check that the output is zero in the no-flow condition.

6. Set a desired velocity in the wind tunnel using VFD.

7. Take the pressure measurements at different intervals of 5<sup>o</sup> by rotating the airfoil.

8. The experiment can be repeated for different velocities to get readings for different Reynolds numbers.

9. Tabulate all the data and calculate C<sub>p</sub> and C<sub>L</sub> using the equations.

    ### Calculations

    - From eq. (3) determine the experimental Coefficient of pressure, which may be called as experimental value

    - From eq. (4), determine the lift coefficient.

10. Plot a graph for the Coefficient of pressure for different values of angle of attack

11. Plot the graph for the Coefficient of lift versus angle of attack.
